- Co-lead developer for Unitel NetShows, a mobile video streaming app for seamless viewing experiences using .NET WebAPI, Azure Media Services, Azure Storage, and SQL Express for fast data retrieval. The app's frontend was created with Flutter for a cross-platform sleek interface.
- I have extensive experience in developing multiple WPF applications for controlling broadcast graphics in various events, including the Municipal Elections 2021 Interactive Touch application, ICF Canoe Events, SIC Not√≠cias Interactive Touch application, RTP "Don't Forget the Lyrics," and more. These applications were designed to enable seamless control and management of broadcasting graphics, ensuring that each event runs smoothly and successfully.
- Enhanced the existing broadcasting solution **InfoStudio** by fixing bugs and implementing new features to improve its functionality. One such feature I added was the NDI powered video graphics preview, which enabled users to preview their graphics in real-time, enhancing their ability to deliver high-quality broadcasts.
- Contributed to the development of the in-house engine layer written in Python that sits upon the real-time engine TouchDesigner. Specifically, I have designed new systems, improved existing ones, and developed plugins to enhance the layer's functionality.
