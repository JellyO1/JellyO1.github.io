I'm an enthusiastic person in everything that I take a liking to, be it software, technology, books, games, or anything else.
I strive to be the best developer that I can be, making efforts to learn new tools, methodologies, and languages that might be the best fit for a problem.
My primary skills are currently .NET, Flutter, Python, JavaScript, MVC, MVVM, gRPC and Git. I also have experience with Docker, K8s, Azure, C++, and React.
